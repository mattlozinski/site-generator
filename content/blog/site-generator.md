i got this idea that *i want a website*

## solution 1 - static HTML

the thing I started with, was writing a simple website with about me and contact info using HTML and CSS.
After pushing to GitHub pages, I realized I also want to showcase my future projects, and maybe write a blog.
It also was not-so-pleasant to edit HTML just to fix a typo.

## solution 1.5 - my own site generator

after experimenting with converting markdown to HTML using python, I accidentally removed my whole directory.
Although I had git, it wasn't pushed to GitHub, so I lost all my progress without a way to bring it back.

## solution 2 - Hugo

after recent failure, I didn't give up my dream of having a website.
I stumbled upon [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
At first, it seemed perfect for me, I found this beautiful [theme](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus), and made my website **again**.
The only problem that bothered me is that this wasn't mine website, rather someone else made it. 

## solution 3 - Hugo with custom theme

making my theme wasn't easy because Hugo isn't what it seems.
It is a huge and complicated project with abundance of features, I wouldn't ever be using.
Reading through documentation, made me question my choice of SSG and I again started to want to have my own generator.
Nonetheless, I finished my website, deployed to pages and sat there dissatisfied with me using not mine generator

## solution 4 - site generator no. 2

this time I was careful with directories I remove.
I also carefully planned out my code and the way it should work.
It is far from finished - todo and optimalization lists are rather extensive.
While writing this blog, I added a few points to both of them, and I'm looking forward to expanding this project.

## conclusion

I learned a lesson from all this generating - always back up everything
